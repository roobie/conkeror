  * New upstream version
    + Closes: #542252 (YouTube download broken)
  * Added alternative dependency on xulrunner-1.9.1
  * Moved from directly calling "xulrunner application.ini" to calling a
    symlinked xulrunner-stub (symlinking xulrunner-stub only works with
    Debian's xulrunner-stub, thanks Mike Hommey :-), so that xulrunner can
    decide which version of xulrunner is actually used.
  * Refreshed debian/patches/sensible-editor.diff after upstream
    whitespace changes.
  * Changed debian/rules to not use the old $CONKEROR_VERSION$ macro
    anymore.
  * Do not include the whole contrib subdirectory in the binary
    package. (Closes: #547896) Only include the xrev debugging tool for
    now.

    default. (Closes: #547908)
  * Bumped Standards-Version to 3.8.3 (no changes)

  * Remove suggestion of zile since conkeror currently can't handle
    text-mode only editors. Suggest the virtual package emacsen instead.
  * Depends now on "xulrunner (>= 1.9~) | xulrunner-1.9" instead of solely
    "xulrunner-1.9".

    are no upstream releases to watch (yet).
